Radio 15.4 Receive App
======================

Receives packets using the 802.15.4 radio on the nRF. Meant to be paired with the
`radio_154_send/` app to demonstrate wireless communication.

Note: this app MUST be used with the `microbit_v2_154` board files. See the
Makefile for an example of how to do this.
