Virtual Timers
==============

This is part of Lab2 - Virtual Timers.

_Warning:_ this lab cannot be used in final projects as-is. Instead you should
use the SDK timer libraries, probably APP_TIMER.

The goal of this lab is to write a virtual timer library. You will use
one hardware timer to create a timer library that handles any number of timers.

virtual_timer_linked_list.[ch] includes a linked list implementation you can use

virtual_timer.[ch] contains the virtual timer library to be implemented

main.c uses the timer library to blink LEDs on the Microbit

clock_time.[ch] is for an additional part of the lab and provide real-world clock time built on top of virtual timers
